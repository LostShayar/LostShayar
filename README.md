### Hi, I'm Aves Abdul

**AI Researcher | Agentic Systems & Generative AI**

As a researcher, I am committed to **Trustworthy AI's** future. Building **Stateful Agents** and **Neuro-Symbolic architectures** that are capable of reasoning, verifying, and acting in complicated settings is the main emphasis of my work.

#### 🔭 Current Research Focus
* **Generative AI & Agents:** Designing stateful, multi-actor workflows (LangGraph) to solve complex reasoning tasks.
* **Trustworthy Computer Vision:** Reducing hallucinations in object detection (YOLOv8) for practical implementation.
* **AI Reliability:** Applying systems-engineering rigor to ensure AI models are safe and explainable.

#### 🛠 Technical Stack
* **GenAI:** LangChain, LangGraph, Llama-3, RAG Architectures
* **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, YOLOv8, Computer Vision
* **Core:** Python, SQL, Vector Databases (Chroma/FAISS)

#### 🎓 Education
* **Master's of science in Business Data Analytics** | Lawrence Technological University (GPA: 3.81)
* **Bachelor of technology Mechanical Engineering**
